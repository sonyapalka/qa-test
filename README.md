## Problem Statement

### Identify and Resolve Code Issues

When executing the tests in `todo.cy.ts`, you will notice that tests `1.2`, `1.4.1`, and `1.4.4` are currently failing. Your task is to identify the cause of failure in each test and make the necessary adjustments to the code in order to resolve the issues. Your goal is to ensure that the tests pass as expected.

### Expand the Test Suite

In the following section, labeled `1.5`, there is a set of tests that has not yet been implemented. It is your responsibility to create and implement each of the test cases, including the `beforeEach` block.

## Extra Points

Add the Mochawesome reporter to the project so full HTML report is generated out of the test suite runs.
